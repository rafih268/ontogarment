# Ontogarment

> Final Year Project for BSc Computer Science

## Introduction

- This project is based on the use of ontological models in an e-commerce web application.
- The web application represents a garments store named Ontogarment.
- The purpose of this project is to make searching for certain clothing products much more efficient and relevant by invoking reasoning.

## Technology

- The primary programming language used for this project is Javascript.
- To create the ontology where we hold the knowledge of garments, we used [Protege](https://protege.stanford.edu/); an open-source ontology development and editing platform.
- Data is stored in a graph database called [Blazegraph](https://blazegraph.com/).
- Tomcat server was used to host Blazegraph.
- The project uses [REACT](https://react.dev/) as its frontend framework.
- Express JS and Node JS were used for the server-side scripting.
